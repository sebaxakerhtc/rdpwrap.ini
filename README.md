<p>RDPWrap.ini for RDP Wrapper Library by Stas'M
<p>Discord discussion: https://discord.gg/N27yFftWP3
<p><b>IMPORTANT!</b>
<p>All thanks for RDP Wrapper Library to:  https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap
<p>All thanks for Autoupdater to:  https://github.com/asmtron/rdpwrap
<p> <b>My modified version of RDP Wrapper can be downloaded from Discord
<p>- added "Plan B" to autoupdate (if my GitHub account gets blocked, you can recieve updates from another source)
<p>- unpack .zip to any place
<p>- run install.bat with Administrator privileges
<p>- wait until you see the RDPConf window with all green-coloured indicators

<p>- Enjoy!
<p>I made changes to the installer and autoupdater to copy all files to the installation directory, run autoupdate, then start RDPConf to check that it's functioning correctly.</b>  (The uninstaller now also removes the installation directory afterwards.)
<p>I like using RDP Wrapper, and now (starting from build 18362.836) I contribute regularly into making sure it works on every x64 release of MS-Windows.
