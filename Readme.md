# RDPWrap.ini for RDP Wrapper Library by Stas'M

## [Discord discussion](https://discord.gg/N27yFftWP3)
  
<b>IMPORTANT!</b>
  
#### All thanks for RDP Wrapper Library to: [stascorp](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap)
  
#### All thanks for Autoupdater to: [asmtron](https://github.com/asmtron/rdpwrap)
  
My modified version of RDP Wrapper can be downloaded from Discord
  - added "Plan B" to autoupdate (if my GitHub account gets blocked, you can recieve updates from another source)
  - unpack .zip to any place
  - run install.bat with Administrator privileges
  - wait until you see the RDPConf window with all green-coloured indicators
  - Enjoy!
  
I made changes to the installer and autoupdater to copy all files to the installation directory, run autoupdate, then start RDPConf to check that it's functioning correctly.</b>  (The uninstaller now also removes the installation directory afterwards.)

I like using RDP Wrapper, and now (starting from build 18362.836) I contribute regularly into making sure it works on every x64 release of MS-Windows.
