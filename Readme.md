#### All thanks for RDP Wrapper Library to: [stascorp](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap)
  
#### My modified version of RDP Wrapper can be downloaded [HERE](https://github.com/sebaxakerhtc/rdpwrap/releases)

I like using RDP Wrapper, and now (starting from build 18362.836) I contribute regularly into making sure it works after every Windows update.
